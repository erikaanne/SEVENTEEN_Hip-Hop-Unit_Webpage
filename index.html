    <p style="color: #292b36; font-size: 20px;"> 
    The <b>Hip-Hop Team</b> is one of <b>SEVENTEEN’s</b> three sub-units, made up of <b>S.Coups, Wonwoo, Mingyu, and Vernon.</b> <br>These four aren’t just rappers—they’re storytellers, performers, and creative minds who bring a whole new energy to SEVENTEEN’s music. <br> With their distinct rap styles, they add depth and personality to every song they touch. <b>S.Coups</b>, as the leader, <br> delivers powerful and commanding verses, <b>Wonwoo</b> brings a thoughtful, poetic touch to his lyrics, <b>Mingyu</b> blends charisma <br> with smooth flows, and <b>Vernon</b> adds a fresh mix of playful and introspective wordplay. <br> Together, they create a dynamic and balanced unit that keeps fans hooked.  

<br>
<br>

    What makes the Hip-Hop Team special is how effortlessly they mix different styles while staying true to SEVENTEEN’s sound. <br> They don’t just focus on heavy beats and fast verses—they bring real emotions into their music. <br> Songs like <b><i>Trauma</i></b> and <b><i>Back It Up</i></b> show how versatile they are, switching between deep, introspective tracks and high-energy bangers. <br> But beyond their talent, their chemistry and friendship make them even more fun to watch. <br> Whether they’re hyping each other up on stage or joking around off-camera, their bond makes every performance feel even more powerful. <br> <b>The Hip-Hop Team isn’t just about rap—it’s about passion, creativity, and connection, and that’s what makes them unforgettable.</b>
